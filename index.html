    <h1> <p>Welcome to my Online Web Building School!</h1></p>
    <p> I've taken all my knowledge of Web Building(which isn't much, admittedly)and put it here, on this webpage. Below is a <a href= "">table of contents</a> with links to all the various "lessons", or you can simply scroll.</p>

    <p><h2><u>Lesson One</u></h2></p>
    <p>In this class, you'll use three coding languages. Mainly, you'll be using HTML, with some CSS and a dash of JavaScript.</h4></p>
    <p><img src= "http://bytemeict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/htmlimg.png" width= "20%" height= "35%"><img src= "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nKxzQGcCLtQ/TBYPAJ6xM4I/AAAAAAAAAC8/lG6XemOXosU/s1600/css.png" width= "20%" height= "35%"><img src= "http://cdn.frontpagemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/javascript.png" width= "20%" height= ".5%"></p>
    <p>Since you're learning HTML,CSS, and JavaScript, you should know what those are. So, what are they? They're coding languages (developement is the process by which people write applications using code. Coding languages are different types of code that are used for different things.) that are used primarilly for writing webpages and are read by web browsers. (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) If you continue on through all these lessons, you'll be able to build a webpage just like this one.</p>
    <p>Now, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are differnent things. On a website, there's text, right? That's the HTML. But the text might be <h3>bigger</h3> or<h6>smaller,</h6> or have <font color= "red">c</font><font color= "orange">o</font><font color= "yellow">l</font><font color= "green">o</font><font color= "blue">r</font><font color= "purple">.</font>That's CSS.</h4></p> <img src= "http://www.gpforums.co.nz/attachment.php?attachmentid=161603&stc=1&d=1253776799" width= "20%" height= "35%"></p>
    <p>But your given page may have <u>links</u>, and they open other pages. That's JavaScript. JavaScript preforms functions, HTML writes text and base code, and CSS makes things pretty. It's that simple. </p>
    <p>Now to begin. Try right-clicking this webpage or really any web page, and click 'View Page Source'. What do you see? A bunch of meaningless letters, numbers, and symbols? That's normal. Code isn't meant to be read by humans- it's written by humans, and read by machines. Let's get you ready to write yours.</p>
    <p>To code, almost anything will do. If you have Windows, you can use Notepad, and if you really hate yourself, you can use Microsoft Word. I reccomend downloading Caret, since it's designed to be a coding and developing platform. <a href= "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml?hl=en">Download Caret</a> On the first line, you'll need to put a tag. Tags are functions within < >. But, I can't do that here, because it'll think I want it to actually code. So, I'll use  '' instead. On line 1, write, 'DOCTYPE html'. Remember, where I use ' ', you should be using < and >. Now press enter/return to get to line 2. For now, simply write, Hello World! Now save and exit. When you save, call it index1.html. Now, open index1.html. It opened in Google! Pretty cool, huh? </p>
    <p> Just so you know, index1 isn't a website yet. But I'll teach you how to put it online eventually, I promis. For now, it's time to learn about Syntax.</p>
    <p>Syntax is language etiquette, that applies in all languages, not just code. HTML, CSS, French, Spanish, English... they all have Syntax! However, an individulal languages Syntax may look different from another. So, rules don't always apply to everything ever. <a href= "http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp">HTML Syntax</a> Syntax is very important, otherwise your code may not work as well, if at all.</p>
    <p>Now for your first real tag. Click on the space right before the "Hello" in your document and use an 'h1' tag. If you're using Caret, you may see another tag pop up, and it should say '/h1'. This is an end tag. All end tags should look identical to open tags, but they will have a forwrd slash before the text. The text you want affect should be between the opening and closing tag, so put the end tag after the exclimation point that is after "World". Now save and open again. Ta-Da! If you did it right, "Hello World!" should be pretty big. Let me show you exactly how it works:</p>
    <h1> This is 'h1'.</h1>
    <h2> This is 'h2'.</h2>
    <h3> This is 'h3'.</h3>
    <h4> This is 'h4'.</h4>
    <h5> This is 'h5'.</h5>
    <h6> This is 'h6'.</h6>
    <p> 'h6' is the smallest universally approved text size in HTML. You can try 'h7', and it may work in your browser, but in Chrome, it shows up as ordinary text. Using only 'h1' through 'h6' is good Syntax.</p>
    <p>Now for your next tag, the 'p' tag. 'p' stands for paragraph. If you don't use the 'p' tag, or really any tag, everything will be on the same line. Theoretically, all tags allow you to put things on different lines, but proper Syntax requires a 'p' tag. Try writing another line of code with no tags. Then open it and see how it looks. It's all on the same line, like I said. Now, use a 'p' tag. There! Problem solved!</p>
    <p>Now, here's your homework; think about what kind of website you want to build. How will it look? What will it do? Draw a layout map, then come back for Lesson Two.</p>
    <h2><u>Lesson Two</u></h2>
    <p>So now you're on Lesson Two. I guess you're really into this, huh? Good. Out of curiosity did you do your homework? I'd never know, so I guess it doesn't matter, but it does help to have something in mind when making a website. I know this because I took a web building class, and they assigned the exact same homework to me. Can you guess what I decided to do? I decided to learn more about coding outside of class so that I could make a website that would run them out of buisness. We had to get up early and pay $180 to join, but this is free and accessable whenever you want it.</p>
    <p>Enough talk. Let's get coding. Open your index1.html, or if you're working on a new one, open that. Remember, the ".html" is critical, or your computer won't know what it's reading. Today we're gonna learn a little bit about tags. This lesson will be a lot shorter than Lesson One, because now you know what it is I'm teaching you. You're gonna learn how to make things <b>bold,</b> <u>underlined,</u> and <em>itallics.</em> </p>
    <p> Now, early on I told you that most tags can accomplish the same effect as the 'p' tag. The tags you're about to learn, don't. Mostly, that applies to various 'h' tags. Keep in mind that all 'h' tags are bolded anyway, so don't try to effect them with bolding. However, they can still be underline and italicized.</p>
    <p> The <b>'b' tag</b> makes things bold.</p>
    <p> The <u>'u' tag</u> underlines things.</p>
    <p> And the <em>'em' tag</em> italicizes things. The <i>'i' tag</i> has the same effect, but it's better Syntax to use the 'em' tag. Still, this is probably a rare oppurtunity to ignore Syntax and have no punishment.</p>
    <p>Like I said, Lesson Two and on will be really short. To prove it, this is the end of Lesson Two. Come back at your leisure for Lesson Three!</p>
    <h2><u>Lesson Three</u></h2>
    <p>Welcome to Lesson Three! Today, we'll learn how to put links and images on a page. Note: you will not be learning to make your own images, but that's ok, everything exists on the internet already. If you want to use your own image using this method, put it online yourself. You'll learn to do that later, don't worry.</p>
    <p> To create a link, your tag will be 'a href= "this is the link"'this is what you'll click on to access that link'/a'. I know that in the example image below there's a "title of link" thing, but that has no effect whatsoever. I don't usually use it, but hey, it's your choice.</p>
    <p> <img src= "http://missioncommunicate.com/_cms/wp-content/uploads/anatomy-of-link-a-href.jpeg" width= "40%" height= "55%"></p>
    <p>To create an image, you use this tag: 'img src= "insert image url here" width= "x%" height= "x%"' This tag is self-closing, so it's pretty straight forward.</p>
    <p>Now, copying a link address isn't to hard, so I expect you to know that. If you don't, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t6xFKvCeD0">here's how</a>. To find an image url, simply right click the image you want, and select "Copy Image URL". For more information,  Remember, when using these tags, use < >, not ' '. Anyway, that concludes Lesson Three. See you next time!</p>
    <h2><u>Lesson Four</u></h2>
    <p>To start, you should know the difference between an "inline element" and a "block element". An "inline" means that you can use one in the same line of text. (ie, 'b', 'u', etc.) A "block" means that it will change the line of text. (ie, 'p', 'h', etc.) Today we'll learn some new tags.</p>
    <p>One tag is a 'div' tag. It's basically a 'p' tag. There's also a 'span' tag. That will put two lines of code on the same line of text. This is more useful than it sounds. There's also a 'br' tag. It's self-closing, and it puts a space between lines of text. You may not need it much, but it's good to know.</p>
    <p>Now for something interesting. To give your text color, use a tag like this: 'font color= "this is the color"' this is the the text that is colored '/font'. Also,you can make numbered lists and bullet points.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To make a bullet point, use a 'ul'tag. Then go to the next line and type an 'li' tag, and type what you want.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li> For a numbered list, do the same thing, but with 'ol' instead of 'ul'.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> To add color to these & other functions, go inside the, in this case, 'li' tag, and add, 'style= "color: a random color"' Anyway, that's all for today. See you next time!</p>
    <p><h2><u>Lesson Five</u></h2></p>
    <p>Now, I don't know if you remember the part where we did a 'body' tag, if not, oh well. Go above the 'body' tag and make a 'head' tag. In the head tag, write:</p>
      <p>p {</p>
      <p>color:insert color here;</p>
      <p>}</p>
      <p>Hopefully you have some 'p' tags in your body. Now, save and open your file. Ta-da! Everything in a 'p' tag is that color! Try changing the tag name from p to, well, anything else really. Anything in that tag is now that color!<b>(<u>Note: This will not work if it's done in the 'body' tag.</u>)</b> Today is gonna be a lot of that; welcome to CSS!</p>
      <p><img src= "http://www.shopteacher.org/mcs/tutorials/websites/css/images/heading.gif" width= "30%" height= "auto"></p>
    <p>Let's continue with text, ok? What if, you could change the size of the text? Without using an 'h' tag? Now you can! Within the curly braces, write : font-size:##px. "px"stands for pixels, so you can make all the text a certain number of pixels! However, all 'h' tags are still in effect. As a note, 15px is the default.</p>
    <p>Now, to make the rest of it pretty. Let's start with a simple border.</p>
    <p>tag name here {</p>
    <p>border: ##px, style type (i.e., dotted, solid, etc), color;</p>
    <p>}</p>
        <p>You will get that color and style of border! YAY! Note: The border will encircle each of those tags completely and seperately. If you want a full-page border, use "body" as the tag name before the curly brace.</p>
    <p>But, what is this? You want the border to be farther away from the text inside it? Try to use the "padding" function, like so:</p>
   <p>tag name here {</p>
    <p>border: ##px, style type (i.e., dotted, solid, etc), color;</p>
    <p>padding:##px;</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>This will seperate the text and the border by the chosen number of pixels. However, if you want to be more specific, try:</p>
     <p>tag name here {</p>
    <p>border: ##px, style type (i.e., dotted, solid, etc), color;</p>
    <p>padding-left:##px;</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>This will cause padding only on the left side of the border. But what if you want the border further from the "walls" of the page, try the "margin" function. It is written exactly like the "padding" function, only with the word "margin" instead. Anyway, that's a border. But what about backgrounds?</p>
    <p>To do a background, simply:
       <p>tag name here {</p>
    <p>background: color;</p>
    <p>}</p>
    <p>Hooray! A background! Well, I think that's all for today. Oh, and as a note; if you haven't been reading these lessons weekly, you really should be. Every month, I change the theme of this site! So, see you next time for Lesson Six!</p>
    <p><h2><u>Lesson Six</u></h2></p>
    <p>Today, we're going to build upon what was learned last time. Now, as you've probably discovered, CSS has limited color recognition skills. So, in the "color" portion, instead of writing a color name, write: rgb(###,##,###). Those numbers will turn into a color. For some RGB codes, <a href="http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm">click here</a>. But what if you only affect some tags? Now, we're gonna learn classes an IDs.</p>
    <p>Go inside a tag. 'p', for example. Write this: 'p class= "insert random name here"'. Now, before the curly brace, write: p.insert random name here. Ta-da!You will now only affect those lines of code! An ID is much the same, but you write "id" instead of "class", and you use a hashtag instead of a dot.</p>
    <p>Plus, we're gonna learn another cool thing now! Let's say that you have two html files on your computer, okay? Now, write a 'a href' tag. Put the title of that other file where the link should be, then view the page and click on the link you just now made. It'll take you to the other page, but only if that file exists on that computer.</p>
    <p> Next time: we'll put it on the web! Yay!!!!!!</p>
